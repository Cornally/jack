          <p>Jack is the culmanation of many years of producing styling deliverables.  It's not just about making a design system work.  It's about making it performant, easily extendable, well documented, and customizable.</p>
          <p>You can include as little OR as much of Jack as you see fit.  The goal is to cautiously skirt the line between providing enough of an opinionated architecture without shoving Roboto down your throat.</p>
          <p>With that said, we'll be providing example implementations and themes that take some design liberties to shove you in the right direction...tripping and falling into ocular bliss!</p>
